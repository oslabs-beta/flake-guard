## How Do I Submit A (Good) Bug Report?
Bugs are tracked as [GitHub Issues](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/about-issues). 

1. Create an issue and provide the following information by filling in the template.
2. Explain the problem and include additional details to help maintainers reproduce the problem:

*Use a clear and descriptive title for the issue to identify the problem.*

Describe the exact steps which reproduce the problem in as many details as possible. 
Provide specific examples to demonstrate the steps. Include links to files or GitHub projects, or copy/pasteable snippets, which you use in those examples. 
If you're providing snippets in the issue, use Markdown code blocks.
Describe the behavior you observed after following the steps and point out what exactly is the problem with that behavior.
Explain which behavior you expected to see instead and why.

If the problem wasn't triggered by a specific action, describe what you were doing before the problem happened and share more information.
