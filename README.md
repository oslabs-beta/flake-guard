### FlakeGuard is a free, open-source software that allows developers to run Jest tests to automatically detect, report, and manage flaky tests in software development.
---
*flaky test: a test that sometimes passes and sometimes fails for the same code, often due to nondeterministic factors like timing issues, network variability, or reliance on external systems.*

**By identifying and handling these flaky tests, FlakeGuard helps maintain test reliability.**

# Getting Started
Installation:
```npm i flake-guard``` or as a dev dependency:
```npm i flake-guard --save-dev```

To run FlakeGuard, simply execute the command
```npx flake-guard <filename> ```
. *change `<filename>` to the name of the test file that you want to examine. 

üëÅÔ∏èFlakeGuard will analyze your E2E tests for flakiness by executing multiple test runs and analyzing the results. _The default number of test runs is 10_, but this can be adjusted as described below.

In general, there is a time versus accuracy tradeoff. More test executions increase accuracy but reduce speed.

## Configuration:
To adjust FlakeGuard configuration variables, you can create a file in the root directory of your project called
fg.config.json
. Below are the defaults, which can be overridden in your local 'fg.config.json' file.


```
{
  runs: 10
}
```
For example, if you want to increase accuracy, you can increase test runs.
```
{
  runs: 100
}
```

## How It Works
Under the hood, the flake-guard npm package is automating repeated runs of your test file. It will do a basic parsing of the results locally to log an object in your terminal with all of your test assertions and their pass/fail metrics. It sends off the raw Jest results objects to the FlakeGuard server for further analysis which you can view at flakeguard.com.

## Run Jest Testing Files
